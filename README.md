# Anomaly-Detection-in-Machine-Learning
This repository contains my implementation of the Anomaly Detection. This focuses on applying anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns or outliers in datasets. I have implemented various algorithms and evaluated their performance in detecting anomalies within different contexts.

## Algorithms Implemented
Gaussian Distribution-based Anomaly Detection
Multivariate Gaussian Distribution-based Anomaly Detection

## Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-coursera.git
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip or conda.
Open the exercises.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to view the assignment code and solutions.
Execute the code cells in the notebook to run the anomaly detection algorithms and analyze the results.
Explore the different datasets in the data/ directory and modify the code to experiment with new data or parameters.
The results of the anomaly detection algorithms will be stored in the results/ directory for further analysis or visualization.
