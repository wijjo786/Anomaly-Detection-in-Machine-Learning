# Anomaly-Detection-in-Machine-Learning
This repository contains my implementation of the Anomaly Detection. This focuses on applying anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns or outliers in datasets. I have implemented various algorithms and evaluated their performance in detecting anomalies within different contexts.
